Ashravan awoke in a world that felt both familiar and alien. The room was ornate, filled with the trappings of his station, yet he felt as though he were seeing it for the first time. Shai had done itâ€”restored him not just to life, but to himself. Memories flooded back, each one a brushstroke on the canvas of his identity. But with them came a shadow, a lingering doubt that gnawed at the edges of his consciousness.

As he resumed his duties, Ashravan found himself haunted by dreams of a life unlived, of choices made in another reality. The weight of leadership pressed heavily upon him, and he questioned whether he was truly the man he had been before. The climax came during a council meeting, where a decision had to be made that would alter the course of the empire.

Faced with the choice, Ashravan hesitated, his mind a battlefield of conflicting memories and emotions. In that moment, he realized that the restoration had not just returned him to life, but had also changed him. He was not merely a copy of his former self; he was something new, something more. With newfound clarity, he made his decision, one that would define his reign and echo through history. The room fell silent, the weight of his choice settling like dust in the air. Ashravan had embraced his destiny, not as a shadow of the past, but as a beacon for the future.
